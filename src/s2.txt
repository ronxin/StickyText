Today I am going to drink some beer. The beer comes from Chicago.

My wife, Lily, likes the bear. She says she would often love watching me drinking. What a lovely wife. I sometimes think the word lovely is kind of very lovely. It makes me sometimes want to cry. Crying in the open air. Air pollution is bad.

I would so much want this to end as soon as possible. My life. This is so counterintuitive. I call it counterintuitivitabilism.
